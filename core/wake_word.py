"""
Local wake-word detection for JUDO ("Hey Judo").

Design goals:
  • ZERO cost when the feature is off — openwakeword is imported ONLY inside
    start()/install helpers, never at module load. If the user never enables
    wake word, none of this touches the app.
  • ZERO latency on the audio path — the microphone callback only ever does a
    cheap, non-blocking queue push (feed()); the actual model inference runs in
    this module's own background thread, so the real-time audio thread and the
    Gemini stream are never slowed.
  • Fully local & offline — audio fed here never leaves the machine; there is no
    network call except the one-time model download the user triggers from the UI.

openwakeword only ships a fixed set of PRETRAINED phrases (alexa, hey_mycroft,
hey_jarvis, ...) — there is no pretrained "hey_judo" model. WAKE_MODEL below is
set to "hey_judo" to match JUDO's own name, but that model does not exist yet:
is_ready()/install_and_download() will simply report the feature as not
available until a custom "hey_judo*.onnx" model is trained (openWakeWord's own
custom-model pipeline: synthetic TTS positive samples + their negative dataset,
trained outside this app — see their docs) and dropped into openwakeword's
resources/models directory. Until then, wake word is effectively disabled
rather than silently listening for the wrong word.
