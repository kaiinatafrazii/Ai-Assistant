core/self_trainer.py — JUDO practising on itself while nobody is talking.

memory/self_training.py is PASSIVE: it only learns when a mistake actually
reaches the user — they say "undo", or a generated file crashes. That means
the user pays for every lesson.

This module makes the same loop ACTIVE. While the user is idle, JUDO sets
itself an exam it already knows the answer to:

  ROUTING DRILL   Pick one real tool. Ask the model to invent a user command
                  that should trigger it (so the correct answer is known by
                  construction). Then, in a SEPARATE stateless call with no
                  hint, show it the whole tool catalogue and ask which tool
                  that command means. A mismatch is a routing weakness the
                  user has not hit yet — logged as an understanding mistake,
                  which rides in the next session's system prompt.

  CODING DRILL    Invent a small task, generate code for it through the same
                  prompt shape code_helper uses (its own past lessons
                  included), then compile-check the result. A SyntaxError is
                  a typing/coding weakness — logged as a coding lesson.

TWO HARD RULES, both about not doing damage while unsupervised:

  1. Drills NEVER execute anything. The routing drill only asks "which tool
     would you pick" — it never calls the tool, so practice can never open an
     app, send a message or delete a file. The coding drill compiles, it does
     not run: self-written code is not executed without the user asking.
  2. Only failures are written. A passed drill is silent, so the lesson store
     stays a list of real weaknesses rather than a training transcript.

Cost: one drill per cycle, two short text calls, on the Groq path that
core/text_model.py already prefers (large free quota, fast). It never touches
the Gemini Live voice session, so it cannot slow down or interrupt a
conversation — and it only runs when there is no conversation.
