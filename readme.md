## ✨ Overview

**RITESH LIII is the hands-free & scalable release.** Say **"Hey Judo"** and it wakes; stay quiet and it slips back to sleep on its own — while asleep, your microphone never leaves the machine, so an off-hand *"I'll be right there"* to someone in the room no longer sets it off. Under the hood it now runs on the faster **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live** engine, and the moment you ask for something that takes a beat — analysing a file, searching the web — it answers instantly *("On it — going through that now…")* so you never wonder whether it heard you.

It's also built to grow: every skill — bundled or drop-in — now **describes itself in its own file**, so adding a tool is a one-file operation and the core stays lean.

It's not just an assistant — it's an extension of your digital life.

## 🆕 What's New in RITESH LIII

RITESH LIII is about making JUDO **hands-free, faster, and easy to extend** — all universal: no hardcoded language, no bundled asset files, works the same on Windows, macOS and Linux.

### 🎙️ Wake Word — "Hey Judo"
JUDO can now sit quietly until you call it. Turn on **⚙ → WAKE WORD** (a one-click, opt-in download of a tiny local model) and it goes to sleep: the microphone is processed **only on your machine** by a local detector, and nothing is sent to the cloud until it hears **"Hey Judo."** Once awake it listens normally, then **auto-sleeps after 2 minutes** of silence. You can also **sleep/wake it by clicking** in the settings. Because it's a *local* gate, background chatter — *"I'm coming!"* to someone at home — never wakes it. It costs **zero** when off (the model isn't even loaded), and the detection runs in its own thread, so nothing else in the app slows down.

> **Note:** the underlying detector (`openwakeword`) only ships pretrained models for a fixed set of phrases (alexa, hey_mycroft, hey_jarvis, …) — there is no pretrained "Hey Judo" model yet. Until a custom one is trained (openWakeWord's own training pipeline, run outside the app) and dropped in, ⚙ → WAKE WORD will report the wake model as unavailable rather than silently listening for the wrong word.

### ⚡ Instant Acknowledgment
No more silent gaps. When you ask for something that takes a moment — reading an uploaded file, a web/research search, building code — JUDO **immediately** says one short, natural sentence *in your language* (*"Right away — going through that file now."*) and *then* runs the tool. Instant actions (opening an app, volume) stay snappy with no chatter.

### 🚀 Faster Live Engine — Gemini 3.1 Flash Live
The live session moved to **`gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview`**, cutting the time-to-first-word roughly in half while keeping tools, all five voices, transcription, session resumption and sliding-window compression intact.

### 🧩 Self-Describing Skills — a Scalable Core
Every bundled **action** now carries its own `TOOL` declaration in its own file (exactly like a drop-in **plugin's** `PLUGIN` dict), and the core auto-discovers them at launch. `main.py` no longer holds a giant list of tool definitions and dispatch branches — it shrank by hundreds of lines. Adding a new built-in skill, or promoting an `actions/*.py` file into a shareable plugin, is now just… moving a file.

### 🔑 Multi-key failover
A single Gemini API key means the assistant goes down the moment its free-tier quota is exhausted. `config/api_keys.json` now accepts a `gemini_api_keys` list instead of (or alongside) the single `gemini_api_key` field; on a quota/rate-limit (429) error the live connection loop rotates to the next configured key automatically and keeps going.

### 🗣️ Gender-aware grammar
Languages with grammatical gender (e.g. self-referring verb/adjective agreement) need to know whose gender is being expressed. JUDO now reads a configured gender for both the user and the assistant's own voice, and uses that to keep self-reference and address grammatically correct instead of defaulting to one gender for everyone.

### 🌐 Real-browser automation
`browser_control` used to open simple "go to this site" requests in the real, already-open browser but fall back to a second, separate, signed-out automation profile the moment an interactive action (click/type) was needed — so a flow like "open ChatGPT and ask it X" could end up typing into a browser window that was never logged in anywhere. It now drives the user's actual already-open Chrome/Edge/Brave/Vivaldi/Opera via the Chrome DevTools Protocol for every action, including plain navigation — one browser, real profile, no second window. If that browser is currently running without remote debugging enabled, it is restarted once on the same profile (cookies/history/extensions untouched) so it can be attached to; after that it's reused as-is.

> Built on the RITESH LI/LII foundation: the **🧩 Plugin System**, **♾️ Unlimited Sessions**, **🎨 Live Theming**, **〰️ Reactive HUD** and **🎙️ Voice Picker** are all still here.

## 🔄 The Foundation Update — in every release from LII

These four landed across **RITESH LII, LIII, LIV and LV at the same time**, after each of those releases had already shipped. They are not what any one of those versions originally introduced; they are the floor all of them now stand on, so moving up a release never costs you something the one below it had.

No new dependencies. No bundled asset files. No hardcoded language, and nothing that assumes one operating system.

### 🧠 A memory that actually remembers

The store was capped at **2,200 characters — the whole memory, not per entry** — because all of it was pasted into the system prompt on every connect, so growing the memory grew every request. When it filled, the oldest entries were deleted and one line was printed to a console nobody reads. An assistant advertised as remembering "projects, preferences and personal context" was in practice a two-page notepad that quietly forgot your sister's name after a few weeks.

Storage and prompt budget are now separate problems:

* **Nothing is deleted.** The cap is a runaway guard normal use never approaches, and if it is ever hit it says so in the activity log instead of on stdout.
* **The prompt carries a core, not a dump.** Identity in full, then the most recently updated facts, budgeted — measured at **971 characters on a memory holding 62 stored facts.** That is *smaller* than the old whole-store cap, so sessions now connect with fewer tokens than before.
* **The rest is fetched on demand.** A `recall_memory` tool searches the full store locally — no network, no second model, well under a millisecond.

The part that is easy to get wrong: **a model cannot look something up if it doesn't know the thing exists.** So the prompt also carries an **index of the keys** it had no room for. Without it, "who is Ayşe?" gets "I don't know" while `ayse_sister` sits on disk unread. That index interleaves categories rather than sorting by recency — sorted like the core, a memory with forty preferences pushed the one entry the index existed for off the end.

⚙ → **🧠 MEMORY** shows every stored fact, when it was learned, and a ✕ to forget it. Everything stays in `memory/long_term.json` on your machine.

### ↩️ Undo — it can take back what it did

JUDO moves files, renames them, writes to them and changes your settings. None of that had a way back; if it misheard you, the only remedy was to fix it by hand.

Say **"undo"** — in any language — and it reverses its own last action:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | move · rename · create · copy · write · delete · organize desktop |
| **Settings** | volume · brightness · dark mode |

Three things it deliberately does *not* do:

* **It does not guess.** Settings undo reads the current value *before* changing it. Where a platform won't report that value, nothing is registered — an undo that restores a guess is worse than no undo.
* **It does not hoard.** Undoing a write means keeping the old contents in memory, so files over 1 MB are excluded and it says so rather than holding a 200 MB log for the session.
* **It does not delete your files to undo a copy.** The reverse of a copy is removing the copy; the reverse of "create a folder" is removing it *only while it's still empty*.

`organize_desktop` gets special treatment — one command that moves dozens of files, which made it the least reversible thing the assistant could do. It journals every move and puts all of them back in one go, cleaning up the folders it created if they're still empty.

**Undo costs nothing at runtime.** It appends a closure to a list; nothing in it runs unless you ask.

### ⚠️ A confirmation the model can't forge

The old gate read like this:

```python
if action in _DANGEROUS_ACTIONS:            # {"restart", "shutdown"}
    confirmed = str(params.get("confirmed", "")).lower()
```

`confirmed` is a **tool parameter, which means the model fills it in.** Nothing stopped it sending `confirmed=yes` on the first call and nothing checked that a human was ever involved. It was a convention, not a gate. And its coverage was two actions — so `toggle_wifi`, which cuts the assistant's own connection to the Live API and therefore *cannot be asked to undo itself*, went through with no gate at all.

The token is now issued by the interface. Shutdown, restart and WiFi put a banner on the HUD and **return immediately**; the action runs only if you press CONFIRM. Nothing blocks — JUDO keeps talking while the banner is up — so this is **cheaper than the old gate**, which burned two tool round trips on every power command.

> The split between the two mechanisms is about reversibility, not about how alarming a word sounds. Anything undoable is done at once; only the genuinely irreversible asks. An assistant that checks with you before turning the volume down is one you stop talking to.

### 🎧 It finally asks which microphone

Both audio streams opened with no device argument at all, so they always took whatever the OS called "default" — and on Windows that *moves on its own* the moment you plug a headset in. "JUDO can't hear me" almost always meant "JUDO is listening to the webcam".

⚙ → **🎧 AUDIO DEVICES** lets you pick the microphone and the speakers by name. Two things matter more than the dropdown:

**The list is short.** `query_devices()` returns one entry per *device × host API*, not per device — measured on an ordinary Windows machine, **41 entries for what the sound settings show as 4 microphones and 4 speakers.** The same microphone appears four times, under MME, DirectSound, WASAPI and WDM-KS, with nothing to say which is which. That is not a choice, it's a quiz. The picker takes one host API per direction, drops the "Sound Mapper" and "Primary Sound Driver" pseudo-devices that just mean "default", and deduplicates. **41 → 8.**

**Every entry has been measured, not assumed.** The obvious approach is to pick the host API with the nicest names — WASAPI on Windows, which in shared mode **doesn't resample**, so with 16 kHz in and 24 kHz out against 48 kHz hardware every open failed. Adding a rate check and moving to DirectSound passes that test on both sides, and PortAudio's DirectSound **output is a silent sink**: the stream opens, every write returns success in ~0 ms, and not one sample reaches the speakers.

| | write(2.0 s) took | |
|---|---|---|
| MME | **2.02 s** | consumed in real time |
| DirectSound | **0.00 s** | swallowed instantly |

No capability flag reports that. So the app measures it — once per host API per direction, on a background thread at startup, using silence. Two consequences worth stating plainly:

* **Each direction picks its own host API.** On Windows this lands on DirectSound for the microphone and MME for the speakers — a split no amount of reasoning would have produced.
* **The probe runs in the mode the app actually ships.** DirectSound input passes a callback stream and fails a blocking read; probing the wrong mode rejected a microphone that works perfectly.

Your choice is stored **by name, not by index** — indices shift whenever something is plugged in. If the saved device is gone, it falls back to the system default and says so in the log rather than failing to start.

### 🔗 It stops forgetting the conversation when the connection drops

`session_resumption` was switched on in the config and the handle the server sent back was **never read** — so every reconnect started an empty session. A dropped packet, or simply changing the voice, wiped the conversation. "Unlimited sessions" leaked through exactly this hole.

The handle is captured and replayed now. A network blip, or switching your microphone, keeps the conversation intact.

It is held in memory only, deliberately: writing it to disk would make a fresh launch continue yesterday's chat, which sounds appealing but breaks the session-summary flow — a conversation that never ends never produces a summary, and the "yesterday we talked about…" line in the morning briefing silently disappears. Changing the **voice** also starts clean on purpose, since resuming restores the server's session state and would likely bring the old voice back with it.

### 🩹 Fixes that came with it

* **The assistant could die on a log line.** Status lines carry emoji and arrows (`📤 file_controller → Moved: a.txt → Documents/`). On a non-UTF-8 console — cp1254 on a Turkish Windows, cp1251 on a Russian one, cp932 on a Japanese one — printing one raises `UnicodeEncodeError`, and because that print sits *after* the tool's own `try/except`, it escaped into the receive loop and took the session down.
* **Every computer command paid for two model round trips.** `computer_settings` made an *entire second Gemini call, inside the tool*, purely to translate the request into one of its own action names — because the declaration only said "The action to perform", so the model rarely filled it in. When that second call failed, the fallback was `description.lower().replace(" ", "_")`, which turns the Turkish for "turn it down" into `sesi_kis` and straight into "Unknown action". The declaration now names all 56 actions and the rest is spelling tolerance handled locally by `difflib` in microseconds. When nothing matches it suggests real action names instead of dead-ending.
* **Volume up/down could silently do almost nothing.** `media_control` and `computer_settings` both used to claim `volume_up`/`volume_down`/`mute`, with different step sizes and no shared undo state — the model picked between them non-deterministically, so a "turn it up" sometimes landed as a single, barely-perceptible key press. `media_control` now only handles actual playback transport (play/pause/skip/stop); `computer_settings` is the one place system volume lives.
* An unresolvable saved audio device, or one the driver refuses to open, falls back to the system default and says so — on both the microphone and the speakers.
* A rejected session-resumption handle is dropped after one attempt, so an expired handle can never be replayed on every retry and prevent the reconnect it exists to protect.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RiteshKumar2e/Ai-Assistant.git
cd Ai-Assistant
python setup.py        # installs deps for YOUR OS + the browser automation engine
python main.py
```

`setup.py` only ever installs what your operating system needs — the Windows-only libraries are skipped automatically on macOS and Linux (and vice-versa). Prefer to do it by hand? `pip install -r requirements.txt` works too.

> ⚠️ **Installation Note:** If you hit a `ModuleNotFoundError` for an OS-specific package, install it with `pip install <module_name>`. The optional **wake word** engine is *not* installed here — grab it in one click from **⚙ → WAKE WORD** inside the app.

---

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **OS** | Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux |
| **Python** | 3.11 or 3.12 |
| **Microphone** | Required for voice interaction (and for the "Hey Judo" wake word) |
| **Speakers** | Required for voice replies |
| **API Key** | Free Gemini API key (entered on first launch → `config/api_keys.json`; more than one can be configured for automatic failover) |
| **Wake word** *(optional)* | One-click download from ⚙ → WAKE WORD (`openwakeword`, a few MB, fully local) — see the note in [What's New](#-whats-new-in-ritesh-liii) about the "Hey Judo" model |
